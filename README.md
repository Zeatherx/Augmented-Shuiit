# Augmented-Shuiit
Augmented Shuiit is a real-time, AI-powered Rock-Paper-Scissors game that uses hand gestures captured via webcam to play against an NPC. I developed this as a personal project in 2022 during my 10th-grade year. Iâ€™m uploading this project as a piece of documentation of my early exploration.
